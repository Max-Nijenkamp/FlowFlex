# Renewal Alerts

Surface upcoming licence renewals and flagged seats on a dashboard widget, and send a renewal notification once per cycle via a daily command.

## Behaviour

- `LicenceRenewalWidget` lists renewals in the next 60 days plus seats currently flagged for reclaim.
- `LicenceRenewalAlertCommand` runs daily, notifies 30 days before `renewal_date`.
- **Once per cycle**: `renewal_alerted_at` is the once-guard — set when the alert fires; a licence is alerted at most once per renewal cycle. Cleared when `renewal_date` changes so the next cycle alerts again (see [[../decisions|software-licences.decisions]]).

## UI

- **Kind**: widget + background — dashboard widget plus a scheduled console command ([[../../../../architecture/ui-strategy]]).
- **Page**: `LicenceRenewalWidget` on the IT/Licences dashboard (nav group Licences). Command `LicenceRenewalAlertCommand` has no UI.
- **Layout**: widget — two lists, "Renewals next 60 days" (software, vendor, renewal date, days out) and "Flagged seats" (employee, licence, flagged date).
- **Key interactions**: click a renewal row → open its `LicenceResource` record; command runs on schedule (notifications queue) and dispatches notifications.
- **States**: empty (no upcoming renewals / no flagged seats → "Nothing due" message) · loading (skeleton list) · error (widget shows last-known + retry) · selected (row → licence record).
- **Gating**: widget visible with `it.licences.view-any` + `BillingService::hasModule('it.licences')`; command runs system-side under company context.

## Data

- Owns / writes: `it_licences` (`renewal_alerted_at` once-guard) and reads `it_licence_assignments` (flagged seats) — own tables only.
- Reads: own module tables; notification dispatch via core.notifications.
- Cross-domain writes: none — writes only its own module tables ([[../../../../security/data-ownership]]).

## Relations

- Consumes: nothing.
- Feeds: notifications via core.notifications (renewal-due alert).
- Shared entity: none.

## Test Checklist

### Unit
- [ ] 30-day window selects licences with `renewal_date` due and `renewal_alerted_at` unset for the cycle

### Feature (Pest)
- [ ] `LicenceRenewalAlertCommand` notifies once per cycle and stamps `renewal_alerted_at`; a second run does not re-alert
- [ ] Changing `renewal_date` clears the guard so the next cycle alerts again
- [ ] Command runs per-company under `WithCompanyContext`

### Livewire
- [ ] `LicenceRenewalWidget` lists renewals (next 60d) + flagged seats; visible only with `it.licences.view-any`

## Unknowns

- `*(assumed)*` 30-day alert lead time and 60-day widget horizon — see [[../unknowns|software-licences.unknowns]].
