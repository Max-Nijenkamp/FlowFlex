# Access Review Matrix

A periodic audit view: an employees × systems grid showing who has access to what, with an exportable
snapshot for compliance reviews.

- Custom Filament page ([[../../../../architecture/patterns/custom-pages]]) backed by `AccessReviewQuery::matrix()`.
- Rows = employees, columns = systems, cells = current grant status / access level.
- Export action produces a downloadable snapshot — **throttled per company-user**.

## UI

- **Kind**: custom-page — employees × systems matrix.
- **Page**: `AccessReviewPage` at `/it/access-review`.
- **Layout**: grid with employee rows and system columns; each cell shows the access level or an empty marker; header export button; optional filters (system, access level).
- **Key interactions**: scan the matrix for over/under-provisioning; **Export** → throttled snapshot download (`RateLimiter` keyed on `company_id:user_id`).
- **States**: empty (no grants → "nothing to review" message) · loading (skeleton grid) · error (export throttled → toast "try again shortly") · selected (row/column highlight on hover).
- **Gating**: `it.access.view-any`; `canAccess()` stated explicitly on the custom page (per [[../../../../architecture/filament-patterns]] #1).

## Data

- Owns / writes: nothing — read-only over `it_access_grants` (+ `it_systems` for columns).
- Reads: `it_access_grants`, `it_systems`; employee reference from hr.profiles.
- Cross-domain writes: none — read-only; cross-domain effects flow through events only, never another domain's tables ([[../../../../security/data-ownership]]).

## Relations

- Consumes: nothing (reads current grant state).
- Feeds: nothing — audit view only.
- Shared entity: employees owned by hr.profiles (read only); grants from [[access-grants]]; systems from [[system-catalogue]].

## Test Checklist

### Unit
- [ ] Matrix builder maps each (employee, system) cell to its current grant status / access level

### Feature (Pest)
- [ ] `AccessReviewQuery::matrix()` returns the correct grid over fixtures in one query (no N+1)
- [ ] Matrix + export tenant-scoped: company A never sees company B rows
- [ ] Export throttled by the `exports` limiter per company-user

### Livewire
- [ ] `AccessReviewPage` renders the grid; `canAccess()` denies without `it.access.view-any`; export denied without `it.access.export-review`

## Unknowns

- Matrix build via `AccessReviewQuery::matrix()` in one query (no N+1) — `*(assumed)*`.
- Export throttle limit (requests / window) — `*(assumed)*`.
