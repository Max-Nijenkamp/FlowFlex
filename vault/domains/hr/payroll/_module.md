# Payroll

Payroll run management, payslip generation, deduction tracking, and employer cost reporting. FlowFlex does not process payments — it records and tracks payroll; actual payment goes through the company's bank or payroll provider.

> [!warning] Rebuild blueprint
> HR domain code was stripped per [[../../../decisions/decision-2026-06-19-strip-to-app-admin-shell]]. This spec is the **intended** design. Nothing here is built, shipped, or tested. `build-status: planned`.

## Module-key

`hr.payroll`

**Priority:** v1 *(assumed)*  
**Panel:** hr  
**Permission prefix:** `hr.payroll`  
**Tables:** `hr_payroll_employees`, `hr_payroll_runs`, `hr_payslips`, `hr_deduction_types`

---

## Core Features

- Per-employee payroll record (stub created by `EmployeeHired`, `incomplete` until salary entered): salary, IBAN, tax parameters.
- Payroll run collects `ready` employees, applies salary/deductions/bonuses, generates payslips.
- Payslip carries gross/net breakdown and deductions (tax, pension, insurance).
- Deduction types are configurable per company (percent / flat).
- Employer cost report: total gross + employer contributions per run.
- Approved run fires `PayrollRunApproved` → Finance posts the GL journal entry.
- All amounts integer minor units (cents) via `brick/money`; salary, IBAN, and payslip amounts encrypted.

## Dependencies

| Type | Module | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Hard | [[../employee-profiles/_module\|hr.profiles]] | payroll record per employee; `EmployeeHired` creates the stub |
| Hard | core.billing + core.rbac + core.notifications | gating, permissions, payslip mails |
| Soft | finance.ledger | consumes `PayrollRunApproved` → GL journal entry; unconsumed without it |
| Soft | [[../leave-management/_module\|hr.leave]] | unpaid-leave deductions via `LeaveRequestApproved` |
| Soft | [[../time-attendance/_module\|hr.time]] | hourly pay from `TimesheetApproved` |
| Soft | finance.expenses | reimbursements via `ExpenseApproved` |
| Soft | [[../compensation-benefits/_module\|hr.compensation]] | benefit deductions feed payslips *(assumed)* |

---

## Data Ownership

Owns tables `hr_payroll_employees`, `hr_payroll_runs`, `hr_payslips`, `hr_deduction_types` ([[data-model]]) — all `company_id`-scoped; writes to no other domain's tables (cross-domain only via events — [[../../../security/data-ownership]]).

## Cross-Domain Edges

| Direction | Event | Counterpart | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| Consumes | `EmployeeHired` | hr.profiles | create stub payroll record (`incomplete`) |
| Consumes | `EmployeeOffboarded` | hr.profiles | flag final run + leave payout |
| Consumes | `LeaveRequestApproved` | hr.leave (soft) | unpaid-leave deduction |
| Consumes | `TimesheetApproved` | hr.time (soft) | hourly pay from hours |
| Consumes | `ExpenseApproved` | finance.expenses (soft) | reimbursement line |
| Fires | `PayrollRunApproved` | finance.ledger (soft) | posts GL journal entry |

## Test Checklist

- [ ] Tenant isolation: company A cannot see, run, or approve company B payroll runs, payslips, or payroll-employee records
- [ ] Module gating: artifacts hidden when `hr.payroll` inactive
- [ ] Four-eyes: approver ≠ run creator → `CannotApproveOwnRunException`
- [ ] `processRun` on a run with incomplete profiles throws `IncompletePayrollProfileException` listing blockers
- [ ] Approve fires `PayrollRunApproved` with contract payload (period totals, currency); queues `PayslipMail`
- [ ] Payslip generation is idempotent on `(payroll_run_id, employee_id)` — re-run safe
- [ ] Deduction math (percent + flat) exact via `brick/money`, no float drift
- [ ] `salary_raw`, `iban`, `amounts_raw` encrypted; decryption gated by `hr.payroll.view-sensitive`
- [ ] Self-service payslip access is own-scope only
- [ ] Concurrent run-transition blocked by `lockForUpdate`; CRUD stale-write raises `StaleRecordException`
