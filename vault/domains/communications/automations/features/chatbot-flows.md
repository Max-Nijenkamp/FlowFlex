# Feature: Chatbot Flows

Keyword-triggered decision trees ("1 for sales, 2 for support") that hand off to a human on no-match.

## Behaviour

- A flow is a tree of nodes: `{id, message, options: [{match, next/action}]}`.
- On a matching inbound, `ChatbotRunner::step` replies with the node message and advances on the customer's option choice.
- Flow state (current node) is held per conversation in `comms_conversations` meta *(assumed)*.
- Two consecutive no-matches → exit to human + trigger the routing rule.
- Flow definition validated: nodes reachable, no orphan refs, exit paths exist.

## UI

- **Kind**: simple-resource (`ChatbotFlowResource`, node repeater/tree editor — Settings nav group). *(If a drag-and-drop node graph is needed later, promote to a custom-page.)*
- **Layout**: table (name, channel, active) + form with a node repeater (message + options builder).
- **Key interactions**: add nodes → wire options to next/action → validate → activate (one active per channel *(assumed)*).
- **States**: empty (no flows → CTA) · loading · error (validation rejects orphan node / no exit) · selected.
- **Gating**: `comms.automations.manage`.

## Data

- Owns / writes: `comms_chatbot_flows` (own module).
- Reads: flow position from conversation meta (inbox-owned) — read; write of position goes through `InboxService` *(assumed)*.
- Cross-domain writes: none — replies + handoff routing go through `InboxService` ([[../../../security/data-ownership]]).

## Relations

- Consumes: inbound hook from [[../../shared-inbox/_module|comms.inbox]].
- Feeds: chatbot replies + human-handoff routing via `InboxService`.
- Shared entity: `comms_conversations` (owned by the inbox; holds flow position).
