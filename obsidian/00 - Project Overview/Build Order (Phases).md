# Build Order (Phases)

The FlowFlex MVP build order. Each phase is deployable and sellable on its own.

## Phase 1 — Foundation (Month 1) ✅ In Progress

**Goal:** Core Platform complete. Authentication works, tenants are admin-created, notifications work, files can be stored. Nothing else is built yet but the entire infrastructure is ready.

**Modules:**
- ✅ [[Authentication & Identity]] — email login, sessions, impersonation (OAuth + SAML deferred post-launch)
- ✅ [[Roles & Permissions (RBAC)]] — Spatie permission system, role builder, permission layers
- ⏳ [[Module Billing Engine]] — deferred to Phase 6 (billing setup after MVP testing)
- ✅ [[Notifications & Alerts]] — in-app bell, email, user preferences; `FlowFlexNotification` base class
- ✅ [[API & Integrations Layer]] — REST API v1, API key auth, `/me` + `/modules` endpoints
- ✅ [[Multi-Tenancy & Workspace]] — workspace settings pages, branding, team management
- ✅ [[File Storage]] — `FileStorageService`, `File` model, signed URLs, S3/local abstraction

**What was built in code:**
- `admin` Filament panel (FlowFlex super-admin)
- `workspace` Filament panel (per-tenant settings) with Settings nav group
- Company, Tenant, Module, Role, Permission, ApiKey, File, NotificationPreference models
- Migrations for all Phase 1 tables
- `AuthenticateApiKey` middleware + `routes/api.php`
- Workspace settings pages: ManageCompany, ManageTeam, ManageNotificationPreferences, ManageApiKeys
- `FileStorageService` singleton
- `FlowFlexNotification` abstract base + `ModuleToggledNotification`
- No self-registration — first account created by super-admin, workspace owner adds members

**Phase 1 delivers:** Working multi-tenant platform with auth, settings, notifications, file storage, and a REST API. Foundation solid for Phase 2 module development.
