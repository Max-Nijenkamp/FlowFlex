# Onboarding

Structured, templated journeys for every new hire. The goal is a consistent, professional day-one experience without HR manually coordinating every step.

**Who uses it:** HR team, hiring managers, new employees
**Filament Panel:** `hr`
**Depends on:** [[Employee Profiles]]
**Phase:** 2
**Build complexity:** High — 3 resources, 2 pages, 6 tables

## Events Fired

- `OnboardingStarted`
- `OnboardingTaskCompleted`
- `OnboardingCompleted` → consumed by [[HR Compliance]] (marks induction complete), LMS (triggers first compliance cert assignments)

## Events Consumed

- `CandidateHired` (from [[Recruitment & ATS]]) → auto-starts onboarding flow

## Sub-modules

### Pre-boarding Portal

The new hire experience **before** their first day. They receive an invite link to a branded portal where they can complete setup tasks without needing a full platform account yet.

**Features:**
- Branded welcome page (company name, their manager's name, start date)
- Document collection (upload ID, right-to-work documents)
- Contract e-signature (pulled from Document Approvals module)
- Personal details form (so HR doesn't have to chase this on day one)
- "What to expect on day one" content block
- Access to company handbook (link to Knowledge Base if active)

### Onboarding Templates

**Features:**
- Template builder (define a sequence of tasks by role/department)
- Task types: document upload, form fill, training course (links to LMS), read and acknowledge, external link
- Default assignees per task (HR, IT, hiring manager)
- Due dates relative to start date (e.g. "Day 1", "Week 1", "Day 30")
- Template cloning and versioning
- Multiple templates (one per job family: Engineering, Sales, Operations, etc.)

### Onboarding Task Management

**Features:**
- Task checklist view for HR team (all active onboardings in one view)
- New hire's personal task list (what they need to do)
- Hiring manager task list (what the manager needs to do for their new hire)
- Task completion notifications (to HR when new hire completes a task)
- Progress bar per new hire (% complete)
- Overdue task alerts

### 30/60/90-Day Check-ins

**Features:**
- Automated check-in form sent to new hire and manager at 30, 60, 90 days
- Configurable questions per check-in milestone
- Manager response and review
- Flag for HR attention if check-in scores below threshold
- Check-in history stored on employee profile

## Cross-module Integrations

When both modules are active:
- **LMS** — onboarding templates can include course assignments
- **IT** — onboarding templates can include IT provisioning checklist tasks
- **Document Approvals** — pre-boarding contract e-signature
- **Asset Management** — equipment request task in onboarding template

## Database Tables (6)

1. `onboarding_flows` — one per employee hire
2. `onboarding_templates` — reusable template definitions
3. `onboarding_template_tasks` — task definitions within a template
4. `onboarding_tasks` — active task instances per employee flow
5. `onboarding_checkins` — 30/60/90-day check-in records
6. `onboarding_checkin_responses` — responses per check-in question
