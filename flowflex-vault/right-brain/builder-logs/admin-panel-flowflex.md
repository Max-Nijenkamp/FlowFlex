## Session — 2026-05-09 (Filament Tailwind Theme — Custom Classes Now Compile)

### Root Cause

Filament panels load their own CSS pipeline, completely separate from `resources/css/app.css`. Filament's built-in CSS only includes its own component utilities. All custom Tailwind classes in our blade views (`module-marketplace.blade.php`, resource form pages) were silently dropped — the classes existed in HTML but no corresponding CSS rule was ever compiled.

### Changes Made

**`resources/css/filament/app/theme.css`** (new)
- `@import 'tailwindcss' source(none)` — Filament's required pattern (no auto-discovery)
- `@import '../../../../vendor/filament/filament/resources/css/index.css'` — all Filament component CSS
- `@source` for all 9 Filament vendor packages' blade views
- `@source` for `resources/views/filament/app/**/*.blade.php` (our custom views)
- `@source` for `app/Filament/App/**/*.php` and `app/Filament/Admin/**/*.php` (PHP class inline classes)

**`resources/css/filament/admin/theme.css`** (new)
- Same structure as app theme but sources `resources/views/filament/admin/**`

**`vite.config.js`**
- Added both theme files to `input` array so Vite compiles them as separate CSS bundles

**`WorkspacePanelProvider.php`**
- `->viteTheme('resources/css/filament/app/theme.css')` — panel now injects compiled theme on every page

**`AdminPanelProvider.php`**
- `->viteTheme('resources/css/filament/admin/theme.css')`

### Build Output

`npm run build` compiles cleanly:
- `app/theme.css` → 610 KB (gzip: 63 KB)
- `admin/theme.css` → 618 KB (gzip: 64 KB)

### 89 Tests Pass

`89 passed (156 assertions)` — all green, no regressions.

## Session — 2026-05-09 (TypeError Fix, CRUD Full-Width, Marketplace Redesign, GAP-006 Closed)

### Changes Made

**PlatformAnnouncementResource TypeError**
- `app/Filament/Admin/Resources/PlatformAnnouncementResource.php` — `use Filament\Forms\Get` → `use Filament\Schemas\Components\Utilities\Get`. Filament 5 renamed the `Get` closure type from `Filament\Forms\Get` to `Filament\Schemas\Components\Utilities\Get`. All `->visible()` and `->required()` callbacks receiving `Get $get` crashed with TypeError on the create form.

**All resource forms now full-width**
- Added `->columnSpanFull()` to all `Section::make(...)` components across all admin and app panel resource forms. In Filament 5 `Schema->components([])` wraps content in a 2-column grid; a single Section without `columnSpanFull` occupies only the left half. Fixed in: `CompanyResource`, `AdminUserResource`, `CompanyFeatureFlagResource`, `ModuleCatalogResource`, `PlatformAnnouncementResource`, `UserResource`, `UsersRelationManager`.

**ModuleMarketplace redesign**
- `app/Filament/App/Pages/ModuleMarketplace.php` — added `getActiveCount()` (excludes core.*), `getMonthlyEstimate()` (price × user count), and reordered SQL to show core domain first.
- `resources/views/filament/app/pages/module-marketplace.blade.php` — full redesign:
  - Summary bar: active module count, estimated monthly cost, core platform info card
  - Domain sections with formatted display names, module count badge, active count badge
  - Cards color-coded: green border = active, blue border = core, gray = inactive
  - Status dot (green/blue/gray) in top-right of each card
  - Module key shown in monospace as subtitle
  - Core modules show "Included" with check icon — no enable/disable
  - `wire:loading.attr="disabled"` on buttons for loading state
  - Empty state with puzzle-piece icon

**GAP-006 closed — 15 new tests (74 → 89)**
- `tests/Feature/Foundation/CompanyCreationServiceTest.php` — 6 tests: company fields, owner user, role assignment, foundation modules, invite token, transaction rollback
- `tests/Feature/Filament/ModuleMarketplaceTest.php` — 5 tests: render, enable, disable, cross-tenant isolation, invalid module key
- `tests/Feature/Filament/CompanySettingsTest.php` — 4 tests: load values, save, slug uniqueness rejection, own-slug allowed

### 89 Tests Pass

`89 passed (156 assertions)` — all Feature and Unit tests green.

## Session — 2026-05-09 (Phase 0 Audit — Bugs, Security, Indexes)

### Audit Scope

Full Phase 0 audit run by `analyst` subagent — checked all 5 modules for completeness, security, bugs, and scalability.

### Bugs Fixed

**UserResource deactivate double-fire (HIGH)**
- `app/Filament/App/Resources/UserResource.php` — action called `$record->update(['status' => 'deactivated'])` AND `$record->delete()` simultaneously. Deactivated users became invisible in the UI (soft-deleted AND status-changed). Removed `$record->delete()` — status-only deactivation is the correct behaviour.

**country field silently dropped (MEDIUM)**
- `app/Filament/Admin/Resources/CompanyResource.php` — form had `TextInput::make('country')` and `CreateCompanyData` had `$country` DTO field, but no `country` column existed in the `companies` table and the model had no `country` in `$fillable`. CompanyCreationService also didn't write it. Fix: new migration `000008_add_country_to_companies_table.php` adds `country` nullable string column, model `$fillable` updated, `CompanyCreationService` now writes `$data->country`.

**AdminFactory default role invalid (MEDIUM)**
- `database/factories/AdminFactory.php` — default role was `'admin'` which is not a valid enum value (valid: `super_admin`, `support`, `billing`, `developer`). Factory-created admins without `->superAdmin()` state had a non-existent role. Changed default to `'support'`.

### Security Fixes

**Email uniqueness not company-scoped (MEDIUM)**
- `app/Filament/App/Resources/UserResource.php:63` and `UsersRelationManager.php:39` — both used `->unique(User::class, 'email', ignoreRecord: true)` which checked email uniqueness globally across all companies. The DB unique constraint is `(company_id, email)` — same email can legitimately exist in different companies. Fixed with `modifyRuleUsing: fn (Unique $rule) => $rule->where('company_id', ...)` scoped to the current company.

**CompanySettings slug missing uniqueness validation (MEDIUM)**
- `app/Filament/App/Pages/CompanySettings.php:68` — tenants could set their slug to match another company's, causing routing ambiguity. Added `->unique(Company::class, 'slug', ignorable: fn () => app(CompanyContext::class)->current())`.

**bcrypt redundancy removed (LOW)**
- `AdminUserResource.php` and `UsersRelationManager.php` — `dehydrateStateUsing(fn ($s) => bcrypt($s))` was pre-hashing passwords before the `'password' => 'hashed'` model cast. The `hashed` cast uses `Hash::isHashed()` and skips re-hashing already-hashed values, so no double-hash occurred, but `bcrypt()` was bypassing the app-configured round count. Removed `dehydrateStateUsing` — the model cast now handles hashing exclusively.

### Performance Indexes Added (migration 000009)

- `companies.status` — used in `SetCompanyContext` middleware and admin table filter
- `company_module_subscriptions.status` — used in `activeModuleKeys()` called on every app page load
- `module_catalog.domain` — used in `ModuleMarketplace::getModules()` orderBy
- `module_catalog.is_active` — used in WHERE clause of `ModuleMarketplace::getModules()`

### Gaps Discovered

- [[gap_company-context-queue-singleton]] (severity: high) — CompanyContext singleton leaks state across Horizon worker jobs
- [[gap_invite-token-cache-only]] (severity: medium) — Invite tokens only in Redis cache; cache flush = permanent lockout
- [[gap_announcement-send-stub]] (severity: medium) — PlatformAnnouncement "Send" action marks sent_at but dispatches nothing
- [[gap_missing-critical-path-tests]] (severity: medium) — No tests for CompanyCreationService, ModuleMarketplace, CompanySettings

### All 74 Tests Pass

After all fixes: `74 passed (113 assertions)` — all Feature and Unit tests green. Live DB untouched.

## Session — 2026-05-09 (Test DB Isolation — Root Cause Fixed)

### Changes Made

**tests/TestCase.php**
- Overrode `createApplication()` to sync `$_ENV → $_SERVER` before calling `bootstrap()`
- Root cause: PHPUnit `<env force="true">` sets `$_ENV` and calls `putenv()` but does NOT update `$_SERVER`. Laravel's Dotenv repository uses `$_SERVER` as the primary reader. Docker process-level env `$_SERVER['DB_DATABASE'] = 'flowflex'` persisted even after PHPUnit forced `$_ENV['DB_DATABASE'] = 'flowflex_testing'`, causing `RefreshDatabase` to run `migrate:fresh` against the live database.
- Fix: loop `$_ENV` and set each key in `$_SERVER` before bootstrapping — this ensures `flowflex_testing` wins in the repository reader chain
- After fix: 74/74 tests pass, live `flowflex` DB is untouched (2 admins + 1 user preserved)

**phpunit.xml**
- `DB_DATABASE=flowflex_testing force="true"` retained
- `DB_URL` cleared with `force="true"` to prevent any URL-based connection override

**.env.testing**
- Points to `flowflex_testing` PostgreSQL database (separate from live `flowflex`)
- All monitoring disabled (`PULSE_ENABLED=false`, `TELESCOPE_ENABLED=false`, `NIGHTWATCH_ENABLED=false`)

### Investigation Path

1. Confirmed `flowflex_testing` database exists and `phpunit.xml` has `force="true"`
2. Manual PHP test: `putenv` + `$_ENV` set correctly — but `env('DB_DATABASE')` still returned `flowflex`
3. Added `$_SERVER` to the test → `env('DB_DATABASE')` returned `flowflex_testing` ✅
4. Root cause confirmed: Laravel Dotenv repository reads `$_SERVER` first; Docker process env lives there

### Verified

- `74 passed (113 assertions)` — all tests green
- Live DB after test run: 2 admins, 1 user, companies intact

## Session — 2026-05-09 (Panel Styling + Layout Fixes)

### Changes Made

**AdminPanelProvider.php**
- Added `->maxContentWidth(Width::Full)` — fixes "half page used" layout issue
- Added `->sidebarCollapsibleOnDesktop()` — sidebar can collapse for more working space
- Replaced `'Support'` nav group with `'Team'` — `AdminUserResource` uses `'Team'` group; nothing used `'Support'`
- Imported `Filament\Support\Enums\Width`

**WorkspacePanelProvider.php**
- Added `->maxContentWidth(Width::Full)` — same full-width fix
- Added `->sidebarCollapsibleOnDesktop()`
- Added `->navigationGroups([NavigationGroup::make('Settings')])` — Users, Roles, CompanySettings, ModuleMarketplace all declare `'Settings'` group but panel had none defined
- Imported `Filament\Navigation\NavigationGroup` and `Filament\Support\Enums\Width`

**phpunit.xml**
- Added `force="true"` on `DB_CONNECTION`, `DB_DATABASE`, `DB_URL` env vars
- Required because Docker container sets `DB_CONNECTION=pgsql` as process-level env vars which normally override phpunit.xml `<env>` without `force`

### Problem Found and Fixed — config:cache Breaks Test Isolation

Running `php artisan config:cache` bakes PostgreSQL connection settings into a static file. Even with `force="true"`, phpunit env overrides have no effect on cached config. When tests ran after a `config:cache` call, they used the live PostgreSQL database — 4 Livewire authenticate tests failed with `SQLSTATE[25P02]` (transaction aborted by prior INSERT failure in wrong DB context).

**Fix**: `php artisan config:clear` before running tests. Never run `config:cache` on the dev Docker instance; it must be cleared before test runs.

### All 74 Tests Pass

After clearing config cache: `74 passed (113 assertions)` — all Feature and Unit tests green.
